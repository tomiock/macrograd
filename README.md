# Another Autograd/Machine Learning Framework.

As opossed to the great coders of [micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd) or [tinygrad](https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad), since I am not as good as them, this framework shall be named **Macrograd**!

> Just tryping to create an autograd framework, like any great ML engineer should do I guess.
